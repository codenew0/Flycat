# FLYCAT

A game built by processing.

Move the "FLYCAT" to avoid the stars, and try to eat fishes as many as you can.
You can click the star to destory it.
Every fish you eat will become a cat claw to attack the Boss "Bickey Mouse".
"Bickey Mouse" is a huge mouse that you cannot catch it directly, but it will get smaller after hitting by a claw.
**Catch it after it becomes the smallest state!**
